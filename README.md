# Slacker

**This is a _major_ work in progress. Not suitable as a daily driver**

Unofficial [Slack](https://slack.com/) desktop client.

## Goals
- Allow custom theming, with shareable theme packages
- Allow custom (shareable) plugins to extend the UI with new functionality

## Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm watch` to compile on changes
4. Run `npm start` to launch the application

## TODO
- Fix bugs with notifications (only work sporadically)
- Make notification settings configurable
- Implement theming framework
- Implement plugins framework
- Test on platforms besides `OSX`
